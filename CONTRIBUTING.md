# Contributing

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer
developers to help this project come to fruition.

:sparkles: Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! :sparkles:

Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Types of Contributions

### Submitting Issues for Bugs, Defects, Documentation Issues

Did you find a bug 🐛 (yuck) and don't know what to do?

Start by creating a new [Bug Report](https://cscgithub.cscglobal.com/INFRA/ansible-role_orapatch/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)!

Bugs / Defects will be categorized and prioritized accordingly
based on complexity, business needs, impact and effort.

If you know how to fix the issue, and are comfortable with making the change
yourself, please feel free to follow the procedures below on
Submitting New Feature Requests.

### Submitting New Feature Requests

Have a new idea, feature, enhancement you'd like to see
implemented in this project?

Start by creating a new [Feature Request](https://cscgithub.cscglobal.com/INFRA/ansible-role_orapatch/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)!

When a new feature is requested, it will be subjected to all types of torture
and pain prior to being prioritized accordingly.  Once prioritized, a versioned
milestone and project will be assigned

If a feature is considered an effort that spans more than 2 weeks of effort and
multiple teams, than an MPL will need to be submitted accordingly.

Fill out as many of the sections as possible for prompt response and prioritization.
